- 👋 Hello there, my name is Arterexius. I'm a Minecraft builder and texturepack creator, member of the VoidWalkers server and general DIY and tech enthusiast, along with being a designer and musician (Apollon95)
- 👀 I’m interested in mechanical engineering and automation of generic tasks. I especially love CNC machines and figuring out ways to enhance the machines we use to make stuff. I also have a deep love for space exploration, mining and habitation.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JSON for use in more advanced MC Texturepack creation. I'm also looking into Python and Sass.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Open Sourced project that help our fellow DIY'ers. When it comes to software, I have a particular interest in UI/UIX design, whereas in hardware, I am more focused on automation of monotonous tasks, as well as increasing their efficiency.
- 📫 The easiest way to reach out to me, would be to send me a message on either FB, YouTube or PMC.
